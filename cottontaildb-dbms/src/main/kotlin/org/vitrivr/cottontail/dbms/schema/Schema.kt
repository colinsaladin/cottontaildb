/**
 * Represents a [Schema] in the Cottontail DB data model. A [Schema] is a collection of [Entity]
 * objects that belong together (e.g., because they belong to the same application). Every [Schema]
 * can be seen as a dedicated database and different [Schema]s in Cottontail can reside in
 * different locations.
 *
 * Calling the default constructor for [Schema] opens that [Schema]. It can only be opened once due
 * to file locks and it will remain open until the [Schema.close()] method is called.
