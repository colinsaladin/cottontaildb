/**
 * An object that acts as unit of isolation for accesses (read/write) to the underlying [DBO].
 * [Tx] can be closed, committed and rolled back.
 *
 * [Tx] objects are bound to a specific [TransactionContext] that manages shared resources
 * (e.g. multiple, concurrent [Tx] objects) and locks to the [DBO]s.
 *
 * This interface defines the basic operations supported by a [Tx]. However, it does not dictate
 * the isolation level. It is up to the implementation to define and implement the desired
 * level of isolation and to obtain the necessary locks to safely execute an operation.
